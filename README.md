### New Things I learned while working on this project
1. Intersection Observer  
it's a DOM API  it manages me to make some css changes on the sections depending on if the section is visible on the viewport or not 
for more information: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
- it was hard to implement it I had to watch these youtube videos to understand it
    1. KevinPowell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8EYosX4NOo&ab_channel=KevinPowell)
    2. Steve Griffith (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ8WggeHoJU&ab_channel=SteveGriffith)
2. createDocumentFragment() method
Creates a new empty DocumentFragment into which DOM nodes can be added to build an offscreen DOM tree.
- Learn it from here (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createDocumentFragment)
3. preventDefault() method
The Event interface's preventDefault() method tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as it normally would be. 
- Learn it from here (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)
4. javascript:void(0); instead of using # in the href attribute in the links
